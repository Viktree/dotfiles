# Vikram's Dotfiles

Dotfiles are a way of backing up and syncing my settings the my setup across multiple machines. This way I can keep the settings and programs that I love and keep any tidbits/gems that I pickup along the way.

As of right now, I am using [this](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/) convenient nice strategy to manage my configuration files for my development environments. I first found this idea in [a HackerNews post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797).


## Computers

Right now, the configuration for each computer is managed using a separate branch

1. `mac/tintinux`: My personal laptop that I use for most things

    - **Make**: Apple
    - **Model** "13-inch MacBook Air (2017)
    - **Operating System**: macOS High Sierra
    - **Processor:** 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5
    - **Memory:** 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
    - **Graphics**: Intel HD Graphics 6000 1536 MB
    - **Storage**: 120 GB Flash storage, expanded by another 120GB

2. `mac/ecobee-web`: This was the laptop I was using while at ecobee

3. [ubuntu-jetson/alcazar](https://github.com/viktree/dotfiles/tree/ubuntu-jetson/alcazar): This is a nvidia jetson that I have sitting on my desk at home.
